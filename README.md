# PokeApi-with-Superlinked
The idea is to implement multi-field / multi-modal search using Superlinked. Given the user query, or the existing pokemon, system should return N relevant pokemons from the library.

This project aims to give better understanding of capabilities of Superlinked and Semantic Search in general.
## IN THE FUTURE
- Use pokemon images for search
- Compare Superlinked to alternatives
- Come up with ideas on how to improve search quality
