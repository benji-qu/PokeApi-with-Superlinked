# PokeApi-with-Superlinked
The idea is to implement multi-field / multi-modal search. Given the user query, or the existing pokemon, system should return N relevant pokemons from the library.

## IN THE FUTURE
- Add more fields to make queries more sophisticated
- Compare Superlinked to alternatives
- Come up with ideas on how to improve search quality
